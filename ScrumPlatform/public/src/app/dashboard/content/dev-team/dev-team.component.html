      <h3>What is the Dev Team?</h3>
      <p>The individuals that make up the Development Team are a cross functional group that self-organizes their
        efforts to deliver a Product Increment at the end of each Sprint. Think of the Development Team as the engine of
        the team.</p>
      <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Responsible for creating and maintaining the Sprint Backlog</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Creates a potentially shippable Product Increment each Sprint</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Provides estimates on Product Backlog Item and (potentially) more granular tasks</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Accepts responsibility for tasks (vs. being assigned work)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Makes commitments to each other</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Updates each other by reviewing progress regularly and aligning work</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Collaborates wiith the Product Owner to mutually understand Product Backlog Item</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Communicates issues and impediments to the Scrum Master</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>To be successful, the Development Team must:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Contain all necessary skillsets to delivery value for the product</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Be dedicated to the group with which they are working</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Be ready to deliver a stream of value and get continous feedback</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Try not to think the development team as a resource but human beings! You would be surprised how often
        management makes this mistake!</p>

          <small>Self-organization does not mean that workers instead of managers engineer an organization design. It
            does not mean letting people do whatever they want to do. It means that management commits to guidiing the
            evolution of behaviours that emerge from the interaction o independent agents instead of specifying in
            advance what effective behaviour is.
