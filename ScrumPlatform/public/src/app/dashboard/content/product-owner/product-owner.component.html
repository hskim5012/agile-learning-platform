                <h3>What is the Product Owner</h3>
                <p>A vital role in any scrum is the Product Owner (PO). The PO listens to the client/stakeholder(s) to gain a complete understanding of what they are wanting in their finished product. The PO must then break the product down into a series of clearly defined tasks. These tasks are compiled into a list, called the Product Backlog, and represent the work needed in order to deliver the finished product to the client/stakeholder(s). The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.</p>
                <p><strong>Product Backlog management includes:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Clearly expressing Product Backlog items</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The PO may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the PO remains accountable.</p>
                <p>The PO is one person, not a committee. The PO may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item's priority must address the PO.</p>
                <p>For the PO to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The PO's decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements and accepts work performed by the Team during the sprint.</p>
                <p>The PO, as part of the Product Backlog, is also responsible for creating User Stories. User Stories are great tools for helping the Dev Team gain empathy for the product. We will go into this more in depth in a later chapter.</p>
                <p>Product Owner is your first line of defense if there were mis-understanding or mis-communication that caused an item to not be reflected properly.</p>
